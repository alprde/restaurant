# Restaurant Finder
![Preview](./src/assets/logo.png)

#### From the name you can assume that it finds restaurants for you. It displays near by restaurants in map and in feed . It gives direction how to go to a particular place.For authentication I used Facebook and Google sign In api maintained by Redux state. This nearly has the urges to use database. For that i used AsyncStorage. All the information displayed are from google map and places API. For that i used libraries like which uses google map and places in the background.
